"""Live battle reports used to calibrate and validate the simulator.

All three were fought on 2026-09-08 by [PRO]Belisarius (X:480 Y:684) against the same
target, [ORM]N2DBLG (X:480 Y:683), within minutes of each other, with the same garrison
lineup (Charles / Sophia / Vivian) and 10,000 troops sent by the leader every time.  That
makes them a clean controlled experiment: exactly one variable changes between any pair.

The per-player "kills" field tracks the defender's *Injured* bucket; the Lightly Injured
bucket is a fixed 1.855x of it in every report from both sides, so total defender
casualties = kills * 2.855.  That is how the 50/20/30 total is reconstructed (its overview
screen was not captured).

# What these two settled:
#  * NOISE: kills 159,421 vs 180,529 -> CV 8.8% on n=2, against the simulator's 7.6% for this
#    config.  My own casualties were byte-identical both times (409 injured, 203,201 lightly),
#    so only the damage DEALT varies.
#  * WIDGETS: the solo panel's infantry lethality reads 1802.9%, and 1802.87% is what the rally
#    panel gives once the +15% rally widget is divided out.  Rally widgets do not fire on a solo
#    march, confirmed to 0.03 points.
#  * RESEARCH DRIFT since the rallies: attack and defense up 317-343 points on every type,
#    lethality and health unchanged to 0.1.  Any comparison across that boundary must use each
#    report's own panel.
#  * ENGINE TERM: subtract the hero-attributed kills and compare the remainder to the simulator,
#    which has no direct-damage channel at all.  Across a 4x range of march size the ratios are
#    0.88 / 1.00 / 0.90 / 1.12, mean 0.98.  Single-run noise is ~9%, so the worst miss is about
#    one sigma.  The sqrt(n_u * army_min) * A/D kills formula is correct -- validated in solo
#    role, against a different opponent with no heroes, from 50,000 to 203,610 troops.  The
#    entire remaining shortfall is the missing nuke channel (20-33% of observed damage).
#  * NUKES: per-trigger damage is stable run to run (Sophia 715 vs 731, Yang row5 819 vs 806),
#    while trigger COUNTS swing hard (Sophia row5 fired 7 times then 3).  So model nuke magnitude
#    as a deterministic function of state and the trigger count as the random variable.
#  * CORRECTION to the note in skill_log.py: trigger cadence is NOT generally deterministic.
#    Only some rows are fixed (Charles rows 1-3 and Yang row 1 were identical across both runs);
#    the rest vary.  Vivian's 12/12/12 across three rallies was a fixed row, not a general rule.

# "Residents" is the SURVIVORS row: squad - casualties = residents, checked on six reports
# across both sides.  It retro-confirms casualty totals that were never shown directly.

# OPEN PROBLEM this fight exposed -- enemy troop base stats are a free parameter.
# Reading the icon as tier + Truegold level ("Lv 11.0" badge 8 = T11 TG8, which matches the
# leader's own troops exactly) puts Narses and the Baron at T10 TG2.  That reading improves the
# Narses fit (my losses 398 sim vs 239 observed, from 672 under the old T10/TG8 assumption) but
# blows up the Baron fit (207,752 vs 117,957 observed, from 111,933).  The two cannot both be
# right, and the likeliest explanation is that the Gilded Baron is an event monster with a
# scripted stat block rather than normal troops.
#
# CONSEQUENCE for the earlier claim: the SHAPE of the engine validation stands -- base stats are
# constant across the four Baron runs, so the march-size scaling result is untouched.  But the
# ABSOLUTE level of that fit rests on an unobservable, so "mean ratio 0.98" is weaker than it
# looked.  What would settle it is any fight where the opponent's troop tier and Truegold level
# are known rather than inferred.
