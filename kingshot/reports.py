"""Live battle reports used to calibrate and validate the simulator.

All three were fought on 2026-09-08 by [PRO]Belisarius (X:480 Y:684) against the same
target, [ORM]N2DBLG (X:480 Y:683), within minutes of each other, with the same garrison
lineup (Charles / Sophia / Vivian) and 10,000 troops sent by the leader every time.  That
makes them a clean controlled experiment: exactly one variable changes between any pair.

The per-player "kills" field tracks the defender's *Injured* bucket; the Lightly Injured
bucket is a fixed 1.855x of it in every report from both sides, so total defender
casualties = kills * 2.855.  That is how the 50/20/30 total is reconstructed (its overview
screen was not captured).
